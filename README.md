# Static Website
Simple implementation of a static website from Coderhouse [curriculum](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pqcSCouyEF0uN_CWZbVqdJkH0HrNZ3VQ/view).

This is an **HTML/CSS** project. **Live version** is [here](https://nacxom.github.io/static_website/index.html).
### First stage | Grid and Flexbox Layouts.
**The benefits I got from this stage:**
* Deepened knowledge of how to **structure** a website.
* Learned how to work with both **GRID** and **FLEXBOX**.
* Learned about **Mobile First** design strategy and how to make the website **responsive**.
* Enjoyed stylizing the HTML with **Animations** and **Transitions**
